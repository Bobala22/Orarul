- Modeling the problem into variables with their domains that facilitate the representation of the problem alongside with hard and soft constraints in order for the timetable to be correct and fair and also try to respect the prefferences of teachers.
- Creating the input filed section on the main page, json building functionality, and json saving/importing/modifying functionality

<h2>Improvements to the proposed project</h2>

- friendly web user interface made with Spring Java API that allows the customer to make his own timetable in a very intuitively manner
- json import of an old version of the timetable and the posibility of modifing it
- alternative of generating a timetable with natural language through the usage of prompt enginnering and GPT4.0
- adding soft constraints for the teachers: maximum hours per week and their unavailable hours in a day
